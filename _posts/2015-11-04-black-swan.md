title: On Black Swans and Launch Plans

**Q: When is the site going to be live?**   
**A: Hopefully later today.**

Late yesterday afternoon we were feeling pretty good about flipping the switch. Our QA team had found a couple of things that needed to get fixed, but they were not difficult to fix. 

And then this happened:

That wasn't the worst thing in the world, I mean... you've been looking at our down-for-maintenance page for a couple of days now. Surely the sad little one-eyed page icon would be a welcome change. I'm kidding of course - this was _not_ the sort of last-minute bug we expected.

## This is where that black swan comes in...

The Black Swan refers to the title of a brilliant [book](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X/r) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb... which, in turn, refers to an [eponymous theory about probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory). Basically - those things that you _didn't_ expect to happen end up having a far bigger impact than anything you could have predicted. It's the intellectual version of that idiom about 20-20 hindsight.

Trust me when I say that we'd agonized over contingencies and backup contingencies... and backup backup contingencies. The SSL error was not even a consideration.

And then, very late last night we discovered one more thing... something that made the SSL issue seem like a cute little cygnet in comparison. 

## So...

We're working furiously to get things fixed and ready to go. All of the student data has been migrated to our new databases, and your new accounts are waiting patiently to get activated. 

Feel free to post questions in the Disqus thingie below... or email us at help@thegymnasium.com.

We appreciate your patience!
