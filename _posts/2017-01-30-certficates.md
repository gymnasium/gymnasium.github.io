Our certificate generation pipeline broke when we updated the platform. You can still enroll in courses, take the final exam, and _earn_ your certificate. But we have to manually trigger the certification process, it's not happening automatically. [Let us know](https://thegymnasium.com/support) if you've just aced an exam and we'll get your certificate generated and showing up on your dashboard.
