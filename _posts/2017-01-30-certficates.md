Certificates are _still_ not getting generated automatically, but we have a temporary workaround in place while we fix the broken parts.

Simply:
- You can enroll in courses
- You can take the final exam
- You can _earn_ your certificate
- We have to manually trigger the certification process

[Let us know](https://thegymnasium.com/support) if you've just aced an exam and we'll get your certificate generated and showing up on your dashboard.
