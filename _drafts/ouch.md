## Not exactly seamless

I clearly wrote a lot of [nonsense](/2015/10/30/t-minus/) earlier when I described what we _expected_ to happen. I hope that when you read it, you chuckled at my naïvety. In fairness, most of truly critical parts of the migration process worked well. 


Remember near the end of Goodfellas when Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) had that _simple_ list of things to get done...

>Gang aft a-gley, _[often go awry]_ [^2]

 — Robert Burns

[^2]: John Steinbeck borrowed the mice and men thing from a poem that was written by Robert Burns in 1785. I'd always thought it was Gaelic, but apparently Burns wrote in [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language). I suppose that's his excuse for the last line of that stanza.

is usually mis-quoted and mistakenly

but he actually borrowed it from a poem by Robert Burns (who spoke funny).
